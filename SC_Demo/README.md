# SuperCollider Demo

SuperCollider is an object oriented programming language based on Smalltalk and C, but focused on audio synthesis.

I've prepared two components of the demo: a file in this repo that is a soft intro to the idioms of the language, and a second demo (`uncharted_world.scd`) where we actually go through the process of making sounds and building some stuff that begins to create more of a "compositional structure".

For now, only a few steps:

- Clone this repo to... anywhere, really
- Download SuperCollider from [here](http://supercollider.github.io/download.html)
- Install SuperCollider

The intro part is not at all required, but it is really recommended.
