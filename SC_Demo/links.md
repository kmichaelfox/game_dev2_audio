## Sound/Music Synthesis Books
These vary from higher to lower level, but all of them require some facility with programming

* [The Theory and Technique of Electronic Music](http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm) (focused on PureData, but is generalizable)
* [The Computer Music Tutorial](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/computer-music-tutorial) (abstracted versions of algorithms)
* [Real Sound Synthesis for Interactive Applications](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~prc/AKPetersBook.htm) (focuses on using the C++ Synthesis Toolkit, a powerful low level synthesis library)

## Stuff I've done with SC:
* [Parallel](https://vimeo.com/122155272) - All of the audio *NOT* made by phones is made with SC, which also powered the network infrastructure allowing the phones to talk to each other.
* [Algorithmic Menagerie](https://vimeo.com/97582678) - All sound is procedurally generated from parameters of the visual creatures.
* [Charivari](https://vimeo.com/82205268) - A game of life inspired audio installation
